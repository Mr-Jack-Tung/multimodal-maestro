## ðŸ‘‹ hello

Multimodal-Maestro gives you more control over large multimodal models to get the 
outputs you want. With more effective prompting tactics, you can get multimodal models 
to do tasks you didn't know (or think!) were possible. Curious how it works? Try our 
HF [space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Roboflow/SoM)!

ðŸš§ The project is still under construction and the API is prone to change.

## ðŸ’» install

Pip install the supervision package in a
[**3.11>=Python>=3.8**](https://www.python.org/) environment.

```bash
pip install multimodal-maestro
```
